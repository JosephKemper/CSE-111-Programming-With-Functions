# 01 Prove Milestone: Review Python

# The size of a car tire in the United States 
# is represented with three numbers like this: 205/60R15. 
# The first number is the width of the tire in millimeters. 
# The second number is the aspect ratio. 
# The third number is the diameter in inches of the wheel that the tire fits. 
# The volume of space inside a tire can be approximated with these variables:

# v is the volume in liters,
# Ï€ is the constant PI, which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter (use math.pi),
# w is the width of the tire in millimeters,
# a is the aspect ratio of the tire, and
# d is the diameter of the wheel in inches.


import math

# Collect User Input
w = int(input("Enter the width of the tire in mm (ex 205): "))
a = int(input("Enter the aspect ratio of the tire (ex 60): "))
d = int(input("Enter the diameter of the wheel in inches (ex 15): "))

#Compute top half of formula
top_formula = math.pi * (w**2) * a *(w * a +2540 *d)
# Finish Formula computation
v = top_formula/10000000000

print()

# Display results to user.
print (f"The approximate volume is {v:.2f} liters")
