# 02 Prove: Calling Functions
# Problem Statement
"""
Many companies wish to understand the needs and wants of their customers more deeply 
so the company can create products that fill those needs and wants. 
One way to understand customers more deeply is to record the values entered by customers 
while they are using a program and then to analyze those values. 
One common way to record values is for a program to store them in a file.


# 01 Prove Milestone: Review Python

The size of a car tire in the United States 
is represented with three numbers like this: 205/60R15. 
The first number is the width of the tire in millimeters. 
The second number is the aspect ratio. 
The third number is the diameter in inches of the wheel that the tire fits. 
The volume of space inside a tire can be approximated with these variables:

v is the volume in liters,
Ï€ is the constant PI, which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter (use math.pi),
w is the width of the tire in millimeters,
a is the aspect ratio of the tire, and
d is the diameter of the wheel in inches.
